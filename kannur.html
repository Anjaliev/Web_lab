        Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was
        once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century
        St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the
        city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace,
        the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The
        palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western
        shore-
